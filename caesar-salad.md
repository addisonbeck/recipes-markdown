# Caesar Salad

## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup (105ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
* 3 cups hearty bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
* 2 ounces finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1 cup), divided
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 large egg yolk (see note)
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) juice from 1 lemon
* 2 to 6 anchovies (see note)
* 1 teaspoon (5ml) Worcestershire sauce (see note)
* 1/3 cup (80ml) canola oil
* 2 heads romaine lettuce, inner leaves only, washed and carefully dried, large leaves torn into smaller pieces, smaller leaves left intact

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375Â°F.
1. In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil with minced garlic and whisk for 30 seconds. 
1. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl and press with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible, leaving garlic behind. 
1. Reserve pressed garlic separately. 
1. Add bread cubes to garlic oil and toss to coat.
1. Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, toss again, and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
1. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until croutons are pale golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. 
1. Remove from oven and toss with 2 more tablespoons Parmesan. Allow to cool.
1. While croutons bake, make the dressing. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, pressed garlic, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the bottom of a cup that just fits the head of an immersion blender or in the bottom of a food processor. With blender or processor running, slowly drizzle in canola oil until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste generously with salt and pepper.
1. To serve, toss lettuce with a few tablespoons of dressing, adding more if desired. Once lettuce is coated, add half of remaining cheese and three-quarters of croutons and toss again. Transfer to a salad bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese and croutons. Serve.
