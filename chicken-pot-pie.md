# Chicen Pot Pie

## Ingredients

* 1 double pie crust
* 1 roasted chicken
* 3 tablespoons butter 
* 2 medium yellow onions, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces 
* 2 large carrots, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces 
* 2 large celery stalks, diced into 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 pound fresh cremini, button, or chanterelle mushrooms, trimmed and quartered 
* 2 bay leaves 
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* Salt 
* Extra-virgin olive oil 
* Freshly ground black pepper 
* 3/4 cup dry white wine or dry sherry 
* 1/2 cup cream 
* 3 cups Chicken Stock or water 
* 1/2 cup flour 
* 1 cup peas, fresh or frozen 
* 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley leaves

## Directions

* Prep the chicken in advance of cooking. 
* Set a large Dutch oven or similar pot over medium-high heat. 
* When the pan is hot, add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pot. 
* When the oil shimmers, place half of the chicken pieces in the pan, skin side down, and brown evenly on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. 
* Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
* Carefully discard the fat and return the pot to the stove over medium heat. 
* Melt the butter and add the onion, carrots, celery, mushrooms, bay leaves, and thyme. 
* Season lightly with salt and pepper. 
* Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to take on color and soften, about 12 minutes. 
* Pour in wine or sherry and deglaze the pan using a wooden spoon. 
* Nestle the browned chicken into the vegetables. 
* Add the cream and chicken stock or water and increase the heat to high. 
* Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. 
* Remove the breasts, if using, after 10 minutes of simmering, but cook dark meat for a total of 30 minutes. 
* Turn off the heat, then transfer cooked chicken to a plate and allow the sauce to cool. 
* Discard the bay leaves and thyme. 
* After the sauce sits for a few minutes and the fat rises to the top, use a ladle or wide spoon to skim it into a liquid measuring cup or small bowl. 
* In a separate small bowl, use a fork to combine 1/2 cup of the skimmed fat with the flour into a thick paste. 
* When all the flour has been absorbed, stir in a ladleful of cooking liquid and combine. 
* Return this thick liquid to the pot and bring the entire sauce back to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the sauce no longer tastes of raw flour, about 5 minutes. 
* Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then remove from heat. 
* Preheat the oven to 400°F. Set the oven rack to a center-high position. 
* When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and chop the skin finely. Save the bones for stock. 
* Add the shredded chicken and skin, peas, and parsley to the pot. Stir to combine, taste, and adjust seasoning as needed. 
* Remove from the heat. 
* Roll out your pie dough
* Pour the filling into a 9 by 13-inch glass or ceramic pan or shallow baking dish of similar size. 
* Lay the prepared dough or puff pastry over the filling and trim the dough to leave a 1/2-inch border around the lip of the pan. Tuck the dough back under itself and seal. If the dough won’t stick to the pan on its own, use a little bit of the egg wash to encourage it to stick. 
* Brush dough generously with egg wash. 
* Place on a baking sheet and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the dough or pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Serve hot.

## Make ahead and storage

To freeze an unbaked pot pie, assemble it in a pie plate or dish. Place it in the freezer, dish and all. Once frozen, pop it out of the pie plate, wrap in foil and then in freezer-quality plastic wrap. Freeze up to 3 months. When ready to bake, brush the top with an egg wash. Place the pie in a 375-degree oven. For unbaked pot pie, allow at least 50 minutes to fully cook it. If the edges brown too much, cover with strips of foil.
