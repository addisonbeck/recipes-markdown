## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). 
1. Set aside a handful of chopped chocolate (about 2 ounces; 55g) and place the remainder in a medium bowl. 
1. Sift flour on top and toss together. 
1. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and espresso powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
1. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating only until smooth. 
1. Reduce speed to low, add flour/chocolate all at once, and mix to form a stiff dough.
1. Portion the Dough: Divide in 2-tablespoon portions (about 1 1/2 ounces or 40g each) and round each one into a smooth ball.
1. To Bake: Arrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. Garnish each with reserved chocolate and a pinch of kosher salt. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 15 minutes. For crunchy cookies, continue baking until golden, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container up to 2 days at room temperature.

# Make-Ahead and Storage

> The portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70°F.
