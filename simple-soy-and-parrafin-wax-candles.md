# Simple Soy And Parrafin Wax Candles 🕯️

> Makes 1 16fl.oz Container Candle

## Equipment

* Wicks (I use 3 for a 16fl.oz container)
* Wick holders (or use pretabbed wicks)
* Something to adhere wick holders to the container, like wick stickers.
* Microwave
* Large (like 4 cups) plastic pouring pitcher
* Silicon stiring utensil
* Thermometer
* Wick bars (optional)

## Ingredients

* 326g Soy/Parrafin blend wax
* 32g of fragrance oil (divided if making multiple fragrances) (optional)
* Liquid dye (optional)

### Bakers Percentage

* 100% wax
* 3%-10% fragrance oil, as desired

## Instructions

1. Ensure your container is clean and completely dry.
1. Attach wick holders with wicks in them to the bottom of your container. Use wick bars to center them if you have them.
1. Weigh your wax into the plastic pouring pitcher. Microwave gently until fully melted with to a temperature of 180-185 degrees.
    * You can use a double boiler for this as an alternative to the microwave.
1. Add any dye, stiring, followed by your fragrance oil. Stir softly for 2 minutes.
1. Slowly pour the wax into its final container, aiming for the center as much as possible while avoiding directly hitting any wicks.
1. Lightly tap the candle on your work surface to avoid any air bubbles from forming.
1. Ensure all wicks are centred and leave the candle to cool for 12-24 hours, open. Ensure they are seperated by about 4 inches, and placed on a wire rack or other heat-sinking surface.
1. To clean your tools: as soon as possible wipe them off with a paper towel and rubbing alcohol.
1. After the initial 12-24 hour rest: trim the wick to about 1/4 of an inch (6mm). Close the container.
1. If at this time you notice your candle has shrunk in a displeasing way: repeat the wax melting and 12-24h rest process with a small amount of wax to fill the gap.
1. Cure the candle for at least 5 days before use :(
