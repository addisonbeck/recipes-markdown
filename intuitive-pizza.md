# Intuitive Pizza 🍕 

> Makes one thin crust pizza and scales up. Roughly double all estimates to make a thicker pan style pizza. 

## Special Equipment

* A baking steel is unfortunately pretty mandatory for good results. A baking stone will also work, or maybe an upside down baking sheet, but nothing will be as good as a steel. 
* If making a thin crust: a pizza peel, an upside down baking sheet, a really flat plate, a big piece of cardboard, or whatever. It doesn’t really matter as long as you can use it to launch the pizza into the oven. 
* If making a pan pizza: a large pan, like a 10x4 Detroit Style pan, 10x4 aluminum pan, a 12inch round pan, 2 8x8 brownie pans, or whatever. It doesn’t really matter as long as it’s roughly 12 inches and oven safe at very high temperatures. I’d just avoid using glass.

## Ingredients

* 🚰 About 1/2 cup of warm water
* 🧂 About 1/4tsp of salt
* 🥖 About 1/4tsp instant yeast
* 🫒 About 1/2tbsp of olive oil, (optional, for flavor and softness. Use less for a stronger dough. Omit completely if you want). 
* 🥄 About 1/4tsp diastatic malt powder (optional, for browning. Sugar works too, but not as well and you might want to use less).
* 🌾 As much flour as the water will absorb. Start mixing with about 1/2 cup. Preferably use bread flour and a small amount (think 5%) of whole wheat, but any flour or blend will work as long as it has a high protein percentage and develops gluten well. Most all purpose flours will work fine. 
* 🧄 Herbs & seasonings
* 🥫 Sauce
* 🧀 Grated cheese
* 🌶️ Toppings

## Instructions 

1. Add the water, yeast, salt, and olive oil to a bowl and whisk to combine. 
1. Start mixing in flour, starting at about 1/2 cup and adding until you feel done. If the water stops accepting the flour you can let the mixture rest for about 15 minutes and give it another mix and maybe add more flour if you want. 
1. Bulk ferment the dough for an hour or two, until doubled in size or a little less. To knead: do 2-4 sets of stretch and folds every twenty mintues. Make sure to leave the dough untouched for the last hour of bulk fermentation.
1. Divide (if making multiple) and shape the dough and add it to an oiled and lidded bowl. 
1. Proof the dough in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours and up to five days. If you’ve still got dough at the end of day 5 flatten the dough and transfer it to a freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. If you really want pizza today just proof at room temperature until you can poke the dough and it slowly but incompletely springs back. This will probably take about an hour. Maybe double the yeast too. 
1. When ready to bake: take the dough out of the fridge or freezer early enough for it to come to room temperature before final baking. 
	* If you’re making a pan pizza: stretch the dough every twenty minutes or so until it covers the pan. Try and let it proof in the pan untouched for about an hour before baking. 
1. Preheat your oven to its highest temperature with a pizza steel on whatever rack gets the hottest, probably around the bottom. Let the steel preheat for at least 30 minutes after the oven reaches temp. 
1. Top & bake the pizza until the cheese melts but before it splits, and the bottom is browned to your liking. This takes around 8 minutes for a thin crust, and about 16 minutes for a pan. 
	* If you’re making a pan pizza: add cheese lightly during initial topping, avoiding the edges, and then take the pizza out about half way through the bake and add more cheese, focusing on the edges. This should create a really nice looking crown of browned and crunchy cheese around the pan, and prevent the dough from collapsing under the toppings. 
1. Lightly salt the top of the baked pizza, add some grated hard cheese, seasoning (like garlic powder), and herbs (like basil) if you like. Slice and serve as soon as possible. 

## Notes

* Pizza should be fun! Do crazy stuff! Use a weird sauce, or a weird cheese blend, or cook it in a weird place! Food is anarchy and pizza is a gun!
