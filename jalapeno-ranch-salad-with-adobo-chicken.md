> Recipe originally from [Cook Well](https://www.cookwell.com/recipe/jalapeno-ranch-salad-w-adobo-chicken)

## Ingredients

### For the chicken

* 1lb chicken breast, diced
* 10g chipotle peppers in adobo, minced
* 5g Salt
* 10g Mayonnaise
* Cumin to taste

### For the jalapeno ranch dressing

* 100g sour cream
* 15g mayonnaise
* Juice of half a lime
* A jalapeno
* 10g cilantro
* 3g dill
* Salt

### To build the salad

* Lettuce
* Diced tomatoes
* Red onions
* Cooked and drained black beans
* Crushed tortilla chips

## Directions

1. Prep your lettuce and any other toppings. Dice the chicken.
1. After dicing the chicken into small cubes, mix it in a bowl with the salt, minced adobo chilies, mayo, and cumin. The mixture should coat each piece of chicken. Proceed immediately, or marinate the chicken for up to 24 hours.
1. To make the dressing: add all jalape√±o ranch ingredients to a blender or food processor and pulse until smooth. Taste and adjust with salt and more lime juice, if needed. If it's too thick, adjust the consistency with a splash of water.
1. Add the marinated chicken cubes to a pan or griddle over high heat. Allow them to sear undisturbed for a few minutes or until color develops on one side, then flip them periodically to finish cooking through and get color on different sides. Once cooked through, set the chicken bites aside to rest.
1. On a bowl or plate, layer your desired amount of each salad ingredient and toss or drizzle with the jalape√±o ranch.
