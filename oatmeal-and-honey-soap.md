# Oatmeal And Honey Soap

## Equipment

* Gloves
* Safety glasses
* Food scale
* Small cup for weighing lye
* 1 quart container for mixing lye solution
* 2 1/2 quart container for mixing soap
* Saucepan for melting coconut oil
* Immersion blender
* Soap mold that holds 40 to 50 oz of soap

## Ingredients

* 22.5 ounces (638 g) olive oil (75%), poured into a vessel at least 2 1/2 quarts large
* 7.5 ounces (213 g) coconut oil (25%)
* 9 ounces (255 g) distilled water, measured into a vessel at least 1 quart large
* 4.16 ounces (118 g) lye (sodium hydroxide) (6% superfat), measured into a small cup
* 1/2 tbsp finely ground oats
* 1 tsp honey mixed with 1 tsp warm water
* 1/2 tablespoon of your favorite oil or butter

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle the lye into the water and stir until completely dissolved. There will be momentary strong fumes released that you don't want to breathe in. Set aside to cool.
1. Melt the coconut oil in a small saucepan.
1. Once the coconut oil has melted add it to the olive oil.
1. When the lye solution is around 90 to 115 degrees F, pour the lye solution into the container of warmed oils.
1. Use the immersion blender to mix the oils and lye solution together in a few short bursts.
1. Add the ground oats diluted honey, and optional oil.
1. Stir by hand a few seconds, then burst the blender a few seconds. Alternate hand stirring and the blender. Don't run the blender continuously.
1. Mix until you reach trace. Trace means when you drizzle a small bit of the soap mixture over the surface of itself, it will leave a faint pattern or 'trace' before sinking back into the mixture.
1. Pour into your soap mold. Because this soap has honey, it may heat up quicker than other soap. Cover lightly with a piece of parchment paper and then a light piece of cloth, like a pillowcase or dish towel.
1. Keep the soap covered, but peek at it every so often. If you see a crack forming in the top, it's getting too hot and should be uncovered. You may also want to place it on a cooling rack to allow cooler air to circulate underneath.
1. Rest the soap in the mold for 24 to 48 hours
1. Unmold and slice into bars
1. Cure bars in a dark place for 6 weeks
