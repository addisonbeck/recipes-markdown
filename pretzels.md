# Pretzels

## Ingredients

### For the dough

* 2 1/2 cups (300g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour
* 1 teaspoon (6g) salt
* 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
* 2 1/4 teaspoons (7g) instant yeast
* 7/8 to 1 cup (198g (in the summer) to 227g (in the winter)) water, warm

### For the topping

* 1 cup (227g) water, boiling
* 2 tablespoons (28g) baking soda
* coarse, kosher or pretzel salt, optional
* 3 tablespoons (43g) unsalted butter, melted


## Instructions

1. Place all of the dough ingredients into a bowl and beat until well-combined. Knead the dough, for 5 to 8 minutes, until it's soft, smooth, and elastic.
1. Cover and let it rise for 30 minutes.
1. To make the topping: While the dough is rising, prepare the topping. Combine the boiling water and baking soda, stirring until the soda is totally (or almost totally) dissolved. Set the mixture aside to cool to lukewarm (or cooler).
1. Preheat your oven to 475Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
1. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and divide it into eight equal pieces (about 70g each).
1. Allow the pieces to rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Pour the baking soda/water into a 9" square pan.
1. Roll each piece of dough into a long, thin rope (about 28" to 30" long), and twist each rope into a pretzel shape. Working with four pretzels at a time, place them in the pan with the baking soda/water, spooning the water over their tops; leave them in the water for 2 minutes before placing them on the baking sheet. This baking soda bath will give the pretzels lovely golden-brown color.
1. Transfer the pretzels to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle them lightly with coarse, kosher, or pretzel salt. Allow them to rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
1. Bake the pretzels for 8 to 9 minutes, or until they're golden brown.
1. Remove the pretzels from the oven, and brush them thoroughly with the melted butter. Keep brushing the butter on until you've used it all up. 
1. Eat the pretzels warm, or reheat them in an oven or microwave.
