# Crusty Bread

## Ingredients

> Yields 2 loaves

* 540g Bread Flour
* 11g granulated sugar
* 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
* 15g salt
* 379g water, lukewarm (90°F to 110°F)

## Instructions

1. Mix together all ingredients in a large bowl to form a shaggy dough. Rest for 15 minutes.
1. With wet hands stretch and fold the dough over itself 6 or so times, rotating the bowl 90 degrees after each fold. Stop when the dough feels resistant to stretching. Rest for 15 more minutes.
1. Repeat the stretch and fold process.
1. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours.
1. Gently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6x8 oval.
1. Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust it with flour.
1. Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a baking sheet. Lightly cover with greased plastic wrap.
1. Preheat the oven to 450 with a cast iron pan on the bottom rack.
1. Rest the loaves for about 45 minutes. They should be nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves. If the indentation remains, the bread is ready to bake.
1. Bring about 1 cup of water to a boil (I use the kettle)
1. Dust the loaves lightly with flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf.
1. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door.
1. Bake the bread for 20 to 25 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.
1. Turn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for 5 additional minutes; this helps keep the crust crisp. 
1. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.


## Notes

* Instead of doing stretch-and-folds to knead you can use a stand mixer for about 7 minutes. With the dough hook at medium speed.
* To make a poolish the night before mix together half of the water and half of flour with 1/3tsp of yeast
