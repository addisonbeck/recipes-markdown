# Small Batch Focaccia

## Ingredients

* 1 cup (120g) Bread Flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast // TODO: Measure this
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (85g) water, lukewarm (100°F)
* 3 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, divided

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast until well combined. Add the water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the olive oil. Mix until thoroughly combined.  
1. Cover the dough and wait for 15 minutes, then give it a bowl fold: Use a wet hand to grab a section of dough from one side, lift it up, then press it down into the middle. Give the bowl a quarter-turn (90°) and repeat 3 to 6 times, until you’ve circled the dough and it’s become resistant to stretching. 
1. Cover the dough, set aside for another 15 minutes, then perform the bowl fold again. 
1. After the second fold, cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 60 to 90 minutes, until it’s slightly puffy but not necessarily doubled in size. 
1. To shape the dough: Coat the inside of a 9" x 5" or 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan olive oil, being sure to oil up the sides of the pan. Transfer the dough to the pan and turn it once to coat in oil. 
1. Gently press and stretch the dough, using your fingertips to dimple the surface and encourage it to cover the entire pan. (If your dough resists, cover it, let it rest for 30 minutes, and try again.)  
1. Cover the dough and let it rest for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the dough is visibly puffy and has filled the pan. It should rise to about 1 1/2" to 2" below the top of the pan.  
1. In the last 45 minutes of the rise time, preheat the oven to 500°F with a baking stone or steel on the bottom rack. 
1. Top as desired and bake for 16-20 minutes, or until desired doneness.
1. Remove from the pan as soon as possible and cool.
