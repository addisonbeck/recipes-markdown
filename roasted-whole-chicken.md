# Roasted Whole Chicken

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken
* Dry brine mix (2 parts salt, 1 part baking powder)
* A rub, optional

## Instructions

1. Spatchcock the chicken by removing its spine and collapsing the breastbone. Optionally, remove the wingtips.
1. Lay the chicken flat on a parchment lined baking sheet and rub the skin all over with the dry brine mix.
1. Refrigerate overnight for best results, but you can also cook right away.
1. Preheat the oven to 450
1. Rub oil, salt, and pepper (or your rub) over and under the skin of the chicken.
1. Roast until the thickest part of the breast registers 145-150 and the joint between the leg and thigh hits 160. About 35-45 minutes. Check regularly so you don't overcook the breasts.
1. Transfer to a cutting board. Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes or so before carving.

## Notes

* Save the spine, wingtips, giblet, carcass, and bones for stock. Chop all the bones into chunky pieces, cover with water, and simmer with aromatics for 3 hours or longer.
* Rubs are pretty free form. Mix any herbs and seasoning you'd like with mayo.
