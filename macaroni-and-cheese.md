# Baked Macaroni and Cheese

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds grated sharp cheddar cheese (680g; 6 cups)
* 8 ounces grated Gruyère cheese (225g; 2 cups)
* 1 pound (450g) elbow macaroni
* 1 cup panko bread crumbs (2 1/2 ounces; 72g)
* 5 tablespoons (75g) unsalted butter, divided
* 4 teaspoons sodium citrate (1 ounce; 20g), see notes
* 1 teaspoon (5ml) hot sauce, such as Frank's RedHot
* 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* Kosher salt
* Some shredded chicken (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Omit this step if making ahead of time.
1. To cook the pasta: in a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook elbow macaroni until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking time indicated on package. 
1. Drain, then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons (30g) butter until butter is melted and pasta is evenly coated. Set aside.
1. To make the sauce: in a large saucepan, bring 2.5 cups water to a simmer. Whisk in sodium citrate until fully dissolved. While maintaining a gentle simmer, add cheddar cheese in small increments, whisking constantly to incorporate each addition before adding the next. When all the cheese is added and the sauce is smooth and glossy, whisk in hot sauce, mustard powder, and garlic powder. Season with salt, if necessary.
1. Scrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly, then add grated Gruyère and mix well. Scrape pasta into a greased 9- by 13-inch baking dish and smooth surface into an even layer over the shredded chicken.
1. Casserole can be assembled through this step, then covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to five days before baking. Increase baking time by 15 minutes if refrigerated.
1. Add panko to a small mixing bowl. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter, then add to panko and mix until evenly coated. Season with salt. Scatter panko all over surface of mac and cheese in an even layer. Bake on top rack of oven until browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes (ovens can vary; check often to prevent top from burning).
1. Let mac and cheese rest 15 minutes, then serve. Leftover mac and cheese can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly well in the microwave or oven.
