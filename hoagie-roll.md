## Instructions 

1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Stir until thoroughly combined, then cover and let rest for 15-20 minutes.
1. Knead the dough for 3-5 minutes until smooth, 
1. Bulk ferment the dough until it has doubled in size, 1-2 hours.
1. Puch down the dough and transfer to a clean work surface. 
1. Divide the dough into two pieces, and shape each one into a ball. 
1. Optionally, refrigerate the dough for 12-48 hours. If you refrigerate the dough let it come up to room temp before you continue.
1. Flattening the dough out using a rolling pin into a triangle shape, about 1/2‚Äù thick.
1. Starting with the narrow end of the triangle, roll the dough into a log, being sure to close off the seam at the end.
1. Starting in the center of the log. Apply pressure with your hands, rolling back and forth as you move your hands outward. The length of the shaped roll should be about 9‚Äù.
1. Sprinkle a piece of parchment with cornmeal, then place the rolls onto it. Cover the rolls with a slightly damp dish towel to allow them to rise one final time.
1. Proof the dough for an 1-2 hours, until it passes the poke test.
1. In the meantime, preheat your oven to 500F.
1. Before you bake the rolls: score them, and brush with an egg wash. Top with sesame seeds.
1. Bake the rolls with steam for 10 minutes, then without steam for 6 minutes (or until browned to your liking), rotating halfway through the 6 minutes to ensure even browning.
    * There are a bunch of ways to bake rolls with steam in a home oven, including speciality pans you can buy for this exact purpose. I usually use a baking steel, a 10x4 Detroit-style pizza pan, and a couple of ice cubes. Launch the bread onto the stone, add the ice cubes, and cover with the pizza pan. For the steam-free portion of the bake, just remove the pizza pan.
1. Allow the rolls to cool for at least an hour before cutting into them.
