# Enchilada Soup

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 2 Anaheim or poblano peppers, finely chopped
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 carton (48 ounces) chicken broth
* 1 can (14-1/2 ounces) Mexican diced tomatoes, undrained
* 1 can (10 ounces) enchilada sauce
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1/2 to 1 teaspoon chipotle hot pepper sauce, optional
* 1/3 cup minced fresh cilantro
* Optional toppings: Shredded cheddar cheese, cubed avocado, sour cream and crispy tortilla strips

## Directions

* In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add peppers and onion; cook and stir until tender, 6-8 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Transfer pepper mixture and chicken to a 5- or 6-qt. slow cooker. Stir in broth, tomatoes, enchilada sauce, tomato paste, seasonings and, if desired, pepper sauce. Cook, covered, on low 6-8 hours or until chicken is tender (a thermometer should read at least 165Â°).
* Remove chicken from slow cooker. Shred with 2 forks; return to slow cooker. Stir in cilantro. Serve with toppings as desired.

## Make ahead and storage

Freeze cooled soup in freezer containers. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Heat through in a saucepan, stirring occasionally; add a little water if necessary.
