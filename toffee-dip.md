# Toffee Dip

## Ingredients

* 8 oz cream cheese softened
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 4-6 oz toffee bits
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions 

1. In a bowl mix together the cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla until blended well.
1. Add the toffee bits and mix until they are well incorporated. Use as much or as little toffee as you would like. I felt 6 oz was a bit much and I will add a little less next time I make this dip.
1. Refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 5 days.
