# Brownies

> [Original recipe from King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/quick-and-easy-fudge-brownies-recipe)

## Ingredients

* 1 cup (120g) All-Purpose Flour
* 3/4 cup (64g) unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural
* 1 3/4 cups (347g) granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for enhanced chocolate flavor
* 3 large eggs
* 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, melted
* 1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup (170g) chocolate chips or one chopped up king sized hershey bar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Line it with parchment and grease the parchment too.
2. Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl in the order in which they're written. Stir, then beat the mixture until it's smooth.
3. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
4. Bake the brownies for about 25 minutes, or until they're just barely beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan. A toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it; you shouldn't see any wet batter.
5. Remove the brownies from the oven; let them cool completely before cutting.
6. Store any leftover brownies, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.
