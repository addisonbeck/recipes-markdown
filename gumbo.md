# Gumbo

> Serves 10

## Ingredients

* 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon (250ml) canola or vegetable oil, divided
* 1 cup all-purpose flour(4 1/2 ounces; 130g)
* 2 large yellow onions (about 12 ounces; 340g each), cut into 1/4-inch dice
* 2 green bell peppers (about 7 ounces; 200g each), cut into 1/4-inch dice
* 4 large celery ribs (9 ounces; 260g total), cut into 1/4-inch dice
* 8 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 2lbs of protein (shrump, grilled chicken, etc.)
* 1 1/2 pounds Cajun-style andouille sausage (680g; about 8 links), sliced crosswise 1/2 inch thick
* 1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) chicken stock
* 2 dried bay leaves
* 2 large sprigs fresh thyme
* 1 pound (450g) frozen cut okra, thawed
* 1/2 teaspoon filé powder, plus more as needed for serving
* Warm rice, thinly sliced scallions, and hot sauce, for serving
* Seasoning. I recommened a Cajun mix, along with thyme and bay leaves.

## Instructions

1. To make the roux: in a small oven proof vessel combine the flour and oil until homogenous and pasty. Place in an oven set to 350 and stir occasionally for about 4 hours. The roux should be chocolate brown when done, with no scrotching or black flakes. You can do this on the stove for about an hour, whisking constantly, for the same result - but there is a higher risk of burning. The slow oven cook is much more consistent.
1. In a seperate pot over medium-high heat cook the sausage for about 6 minutes until brown. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
1. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and season lightly with salt. Add all of the roux and cook over medium-high heat, stirring and scraping, until softened, about 10 minutes. Lower heat to medium if any of the ingredients threaten to scorch.
1. Stir in garlic and season, stirring, for 2 minutes longer.
1. Add stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a gentle simmer, then allow to cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1.5 hours. 
1. Add okra, if using, along with sausage and shredded chicken, and gently simmer, uncovered, for 25 minutes longer. Add any shrimp and simmer for 5 more minutes. Skim any fat from the surface as it accumulates.
1. Remove from heat and add filé powder, if using, stirring well to break up any small lumps. Season gumbo with salt. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.
1. Serve gumbo with warm rice, sprinkling sliced scallions on top of each bowl. Pass hot sauce at the table, as well as filé powder, if desired, to lightly shake on top of each serving of gumbo and rice.

## Notes

* Add the okra in the last 30 minutes of cooking to help thicken the stew.
* Add any shrimp during the last 5 minutes of cooking to keep them from overcooking.
