# Buttermilk Biscuits

## Ingredients

* 3 cups (360g) All-Purpose Flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 6 tablespoons (85g) cold butter, cut into small cubes
* 1 cup to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (227g to 255g) buttermilk, cold

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F.
1. Whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar.
1. Work the butter into the flour mixture using your fingers. Your goal is an evenly crumbly mixture (think breadcrumbs).
1. Drizzle the smaller amount of buttermilk evenly over the flour mixture. Mix quickly and gently for about 15 seconds, until you've made a cohesive dough. If the mixture seems dry and won't come together, don't keep working it; drizzle in enough milk — up to an additional 2 tablespoons (28g) to make it cohesive.
1. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Pat it into a rough rectangle about 3/4" thick. Fold it into thirds like a letter and roll gently with a floured rolling pin until the dough is 3/4" thick again.
1. Cut the dough into circles with a biscuit cutter for traditional round biscuits; a 2 3/8" cutter makes nice-sized biscuits. Or to avoid leftover dough scraps, cut the dough into squares or diamonds with a bench knife or sharp knife.
1. Place the biscuits bottom side up & close together on your prepared baking sheet. Brush the biscuits with milk, to enhance browning.
1. Optionally, chill the biscuits in the fridge for 20 minutes or so. This helps them keep shape, and keeps the butter cold.
1. Bake the biscuits for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're lightly browned. Remove them from the oven, and serve warm.
