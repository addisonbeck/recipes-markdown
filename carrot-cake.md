> [Original recipe from King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/king-arthurs-carrot-cake-recipe)

## Ingredients

### Cake

* 1 1/4 cups (248g) vegetable oil
* 2 cups (397g) granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon (7g) cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon cloves
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* 3 cups (326g) carrots, finely grated
* 1 1/2 cups (170g) chopped pecans or walnuts, toasted for best flavor*

### Frosting

* 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, room temperature
* one 8-ounce package (227g) cream cheese, room temperature
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract or 1/2 teaspoon King Arthur Fiori di Sicilia
* 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups (283g to 397g) confectioners' sugar
* 1 teaspoon milk or heavy cream, optional, if necessary to thin frosting

## Instructions

1. To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease two 9" round layer pans, or one 9" x 13" pan.
2. Beat together the oil, sugar, salt, eggs, spices, baking powder, and baking soda.
3. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. 
4. Add the flour, stirring until well blended.
5. Add the carrots and nuts, and mix until just blended. Pour into the prepared pan(s).
6. Bake the cake(s) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Allow the cake(s) to cool completely before frosting. If you're using round layer pans, remove the layers from the pans after about 15 minutes, and place them on a rack to cool.
7. To make the frosting: Beat the butter and cream cheese together until smooth. Add the salt and vanilla. Beat in the sugar. Add a teaspoon of milk or cream if the frosting is too stiff to spread; add additional sugar if it's too thin.
8. Frost the sheet cake right in the pan. For the layers, frost the top of one layer, top with the second layer, and frost the top and sides of the cake. For helpful tips, see our blog post: How to assemble and frost a layer cake.
9. Refrigerate the cake. An hour or so before serving, remove it from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature. Refrigerate any leftovers, well wrapped, for a day or so; freeze for longer storage.

## Tips 

* To toast nuts, spread them in a single layer in an ungreased baking pan. Bake them for 6 to 8 minutes in a preheated 350°F oven, until they're a light golden brown and smell toasty.
