# Overnight Dutch Oven Loaf

## Ingredients

* 400g white bread flour
* 100g whole wheat flour
* 380g 90-95 degreee water
* 11g salt
* 3g (1tsp) instant yeast
* 100g levain (optional)

## Instructions

1. Measure the water into a 6-quart round tub
1. If you have levain, add 100 grams from the fridge and stir it up
1. Add both flours and mix until incorportated
1. Sprinkle the salt and yeast on top. Cover and allow to rest for 15-20 minutes
1. Mix by hand, stretching and folding the dough all the way around 3 times or so until everything is mixed, then alternating pincer cuts and folds until everything is incorporated. Let the dough rest for a few minutes, then fold for another 30 seconds or so until it tightens up. The target temp of the finished mix is around 75.
1. Let the dough rise for about 3 hours. Fold it 3 times along the way when it relaxes to the edge, but make sure to leave it alone for the last hour. At the end of the first rise the dough edge should be about 0.5 inches from the 2-quart line. It should be domed.
1. Gently remove the dough from the tub and shape it into a round.
1. Proof the dough in a wicker basket in a plastic bag in the fridge for 10-14 hours
1. Preheat your oven to 475 with a dutch oven as high up as it can go in your oven for 45 minutes or so.
1. Gently invert the dough out of its basket, being as careful as possible not to apply pressure that will degas the dough. Careful drop it into the hot dutch oven.
1. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes, and then uncovered checking every 5 minutes until it looks as brown as you want.
