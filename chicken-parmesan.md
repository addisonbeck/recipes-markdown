## Equipment

* Cast iron pan for shallow frying
* Baking sheet
* Broiler
* 3 shallow dishes for a frying staion

## Ingredients

* Kosher salt and black pepper
* Bonesless skinless chicken breasts, split and opened like a book.
* Buttermilk: to marinade
* Garlic: to marinade
* All purpose flour: to coat
* Cracked large eggs whisked with a splash of buttermilk: to coat
* Bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesan: to coat
* Peanute oil (or whatever): for frying
* Red sauce (or any sauce your want if you are getting wild)
* Fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch chunks: for topping
* More grated parmesan: for topping
* Fresh herbs, optional

## Instructions

1. Add buttermilk, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and chicken to a ziplock bag. Massage and incorporated until all the chicken is coated in the mixture. Press out the air, and seal. Marinate for 1-24 hours. The longer, the better, but anything past 24 hours will degrade.
1. Mix breadcrumbs and parm in a shallow dish for coating. Add a few splashes of buttermilk and incorporate.
1. Place flour in a second shallow dish. 
1. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon of the flour in a third dish.
1. Heat enough oil to shallow fry in a large skillet until it hits 375F. Meanwhile: working one piece of chicken at a time, remove from the bag and add to flour. Turn to coat, shake off excess, and add to egg mixture. Turn to coat, letting excess drip off, and add to bread crumb mixture. Turn to coat, piling crumbs on top and pressing down firmly so a thick layer adheres.
1. Once the oil is at temp: fry the chicken. Swirl the pan gently and loosen the chicken if it sticks. Fry on the first side until chicken is golden-brown and crisp on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip chicken and cook until golden brown on second side. Transfer chicken to your baking sheet and add a bit of salt immediatly.
1. Top each piece with a layer of sauce, sliced mozzarella, and parmesan. Put the baking sheet under your broiler until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and browing.
1. Garnish the chicken pieces with herbs, and serve over pasta, or on bread (or whatever), adding extra sauce as desired.
