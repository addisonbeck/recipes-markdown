## Signs of ripeness

After 7 days look for these signs that your start is ready to use:

1. There are bubbles on the surface and sides
1. The consistency has loosened since first mixing and it will be very easy to stir
1. It has a pleasantly sour aroma (not too much)
1. It has risen to some degree (at least 30%)
