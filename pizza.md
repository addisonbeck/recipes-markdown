## Dough

### Detroit Style

#### Ingredients

* 3 cups (360g) Bread Flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons (8g) salt
* 1 teaspoon (3g) instant yeast
* 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons (270g) water, lukewarm (95°F)
* generous 2 tablespoons (27g) olive oil, divided
* Toppings

#### Directions

1. Whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast until well combined. 
1. Add the water and 1 generous tablespoon (15g) of the olive oil. Mix until thoroughly combined and homogenous.
1. Cover the dough and for 15 minutes, then give it a bowl fold: Use a wet hand to grab a section of dough from one side, lift it up, then press it down into the middle. Give the bowl a quarter-turn (90°) and repeat 3 to 6 times, until you’ve circled the dough and it’s become resistant to stretching. 
1. Cover the dough, set aside for another 15 minutes, then perform the bowl fold again. 
1. After the second bowl fold, cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 60 to 90 minutes, until it’s slightly puffy but not necessarily doubled in size.  
1. Preheat the oven to 500°F with a baking stone or steel inside. 
1. Coat the inside of the pan with olive oil, being sure to oil up the side of the pan. Transfer the dough to the pan and turn once to coat in oil. 
1. Gently press and stretch the dough, using your fingertips to dimple the surface and encourage it to cover the entire pan. (If your dough resists, cover it, let it rest for 30 minutes, try again, and then proceed with the recipe.)  
1. Cover the dough and let it rest for 45 to 60 minutes, until slightly puffy (there should be some bubbles on the surface and edges, but the dough will not have doubled in size).  
1. Top the pizza and bake for 16 to 20 minutes. 
1. Remove the pizza from the oven and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Let the pizza cool very briefly; carefully transfer it from the pan to a cooling rack or cutting surface. This will prevent the crust from becoming soggy. Top pizza with grated cheese and fresh herbs, if desired. 

#### Make Ahead And Storage

* Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. To reheat, wrap in foil and place in a low-temperature oven until warm.
* There are two ways to make this dough ahead of time. In both cases, refrigerating the dough will slow the rise times and enhance the flavor of the crust. 
  * After the second fold (step 4), cover the bowl tightly and transfer the dough to the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours, until the dough is puffy; there will be bubbles on the surface. Your dough will need to temper before you stretch it into the pan, and the second rise (step 8) will be longer. 
  * Alternatively, shape the dough in the pan (step 6), then cover the pan tightly and place in the refrigerator for 6 to 24 hours. When you’re ready to bake, place the pan on the counter until slightly puffy, about 60 to 90 minutes. 

### 1-Hour Thin Crust

#### Ingredients

* 152g water, lukewarm
* 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 240g Bread Flour
* 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 35g olive oil

#### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F with a pizza stone in the bottom, if you're using one.
1. Mix the ingredients together to make a cohesive, somewhat sticky dough. If it's sticking to your fingers, mix in additional flour.
1. Divide the dough in half, pat each half into a disk, and place on a lightly floured piece of parchment or waxed paper. 
1. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes, while your oven gets good and hot.
1. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll between two pieces of lightly greased parchment. Roll a 12" circle; don't worry about making it perfectly round, an oval is fine. The rolled crust should be very thin.
1. Top the crust with about 3 to 4 tablespoons sauce, and your preferred toppings.
1. Transfer the pizza, parchment and all, to your baking stone. Bake for about 8 minutes, until the crust is brown and the toppings are heated through. Remove from the oven and serve.
