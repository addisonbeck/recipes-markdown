# Mayonnaise

## Ingredients

> Makes 1 Cup

* 1 egg yolk
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1 clove of garlic
* 1 tablespoon of water
* 1/2 cup canola oil
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* Salt + Pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, garlic (if using), and 1 tablespoon water in a tall, narrow cup just wide enough that the head of the blender fits in the bottom. Carefully pour the canola oil on top. Slowly submerge the head of the blender, reaching the bottom of the cup. Holding the cup flat and steady, turn on the blender. It should create a vortex, slowly pulling the oil down and creating a smooth, creamy mayonnaise. 
1. Slowly lift the head until all the oil is incorporated. Scrape the mixture out into a medium bowl set in a heavy saucepan lined with a towel to stabilize it. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste and whisk to combine. Whisk in up to 1 tablespoon more water, until the desired consistency is reached. The mayonnaise can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
