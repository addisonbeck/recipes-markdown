# Lasagna Cassarole

## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef
* 1/4 cup chopped onion
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper, divided
* 1 pound medium pasta shells, cooked and drained
* 4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided
* 3 cups 4% cottage cheese
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
* 24 ounces tomato sauce

## Directions

1. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain. Sprinkle with salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside.
1. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, 3 cups mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley and remaining pepper. Transfer to a greased shallow 3-qt. or 13x9-in. baking dish. Top with beef mixture and spaghetti sauce (dish will be full).
1. Cover and bake at 350° for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, until bubbly and cheese is melted, 15 minutes longer. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

## Make ahead and storage

Sprinkle casserole with remaining mozzarella cheese. Cover and freeze unbaked casserole. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350°. Bake casserole as directed, increasing time as necessary until heated through and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165°.
