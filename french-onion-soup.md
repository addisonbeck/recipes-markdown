# French Onion Soup

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 5 pounds yellow onions, finely sliced
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/4 teaspoon baking sode
* Kosher salt
* 1/4 cup dry sherry
* 6 cups homemade or low-sodium canned chicken stock
* 2 bay leaves
* 6 to 8 sprigs fresh thyme
* Black pepper
* 1 baguette, sliced
* 8 ounces Gruyere cheese

## Instructions

1. Pour the sugar into a large Dutch oven and cook over high heat, swirling the pot gently as the sugar melts, until it is completely liquid and golden brown caramel.
1. Add the onions and cook, stirring and tossing constantly until they are evenly coated in the caramel, about 30 seconds. 
1. Add the butter, baking powder, and 2 teaspoons of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are light golden brown and a brown coasting has started to build up on the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes.
1. Add 2 tablespoons water and scrape the browned coating from the bottom of the pot. Shake the pot to distribute the onions evenly over the bottom and cook, shaking occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and the browned coating starts to build up again, about 5 minutes. Add 2 more tablespoons water and repeat, allowing the coating to build up and scraping it off, hen repeat two more times By this point the onions should be a deep brown. If not, continue the deglazing and stirring process until the desired color is reached. 
1. Add the sherry, chicken stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a boild and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the liquid is deeply flavored and slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Discard bay leaves and thyme.
1. To serve, heat the broiler. Float croutons and cheese over the top of the soup and broil until melted, bubbly, and golden brown.
