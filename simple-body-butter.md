# Simple Body Butter ðŸ§´

## Equipment

* Food scale
* Double boiler with about 1 pint capacity: for melting & mixing your fats
* Stand or hand mixer: for whipping
* 4-cup heat proof container (or the bowl of your stand mixer): for mixing
* One or more final storage containers

## Ingredients

* 142g shea butter
* 71g liquid carrier oils of your choice, plus more as desired for texture
* 4g fragrance oils (2% dilution rate)

### Bakers Percentage

* 66% base oil
* 33% carrier oil
* 2% fragrance (as subset of total combined oil)

## Instructions

1. Weigh your fats into the container they will melt in. If you are using a heat sensitive carrier oil (like rosehip) wait until after you remove the fat from the heat to add it.
1. Melt and mix your fats gently in a double boiler
1. Remove the fats from the heat and pour them into your mixing container.
1. Place in the refrigerator to cool, about 35 to 55 minutes, or until it turns opaque and develops a solid layer on top. You want the chilled mixture to be on the more solid side, but not rock hard.
1. Using your mixer, beat for a minute, then add fragrance oils, if using. Continue mixing until light and fluffy. If the butter seems too stiff while mixing, blend in more carrier oil, about 7g at a time.
1. You can scoop into containers right away, but for a fluffier butter â€“ cover the butter and let it sit overnight and rewhip it with your mixer the next day, adding more oil if needed to make it a lighter consistency, then fill into containers.
