# Chocolate Focaccia 🍫

> Original recipe from [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/double-chocolate-focaccia-recipe)

## Ingredients

* 250g bread flour
* 25g granulated sugar
* 11g cocoa (the darker the better)
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1 teaspoon instant yeast
* 256g water, lukewarm
* 50g extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 170g chocolate, chopped

## Instructions

1. To make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, yeast, water, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and vanilla. 
1. Mix on medium-low speed until no dry patches of flour remain, about 1 minute, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. 
1. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 minutes.  
1. Continue mixing with the flat beater attachment on medium to medium-high speed until the dough shows some extensibility when the beater is pulled out of the bowl, about 15 minutes. 
1. Add the chocolate, then continue mixing on medium speed for 1 minute more, or until the chocolate is evenly distributed. The dough will still be very wet and somewhat slack at this point. 
1. Cover the dough and let it rest in a warm spot (75°F to 80°F) until the dough is slightly puffy, about 1 hour. 
1. Spray the bottom of an 8" square or 9" round pan with nonstick spray (to prevent sticking), then add 2 tablespoons (25g) of the olive oil (for flavor). Use a brush or your fingers to evenly distribute the oil in the pan and halfway up the sides. (The oil will pool slightly in the bottom of the pan.) 
1. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and press it into the edges with greased (or wet) fingers. Some of the olive oil from the bottom of the pan will make its way to the top of the dough. 
1. Cover and let it rise in a warm spot (75°F to 80°F) until very puffy, marshmallow-y, and visible bubbles begin to form on top, 2 to 3 hours.  
1. To bake: Near the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 475°F with a rack positioned in the middle.  
1. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over the top of the dough, then gently dimple it with greased or wet fingers. The dough will deflate slightly and may form irregular bubbles; that’s OK. If using Swedish Pearl Sugar, sprinkle it evenly over the dough.  
1. Reduce the oven temperature to 450°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the top of the dough has a matte finish and the internal temperature reaches 210°F when tested with a digital thermometer. 
1. Remove the chocolate focaccia from the oven. Using a small offset spatula or bench knife, immediately loosen the edges of the focaccia from the sides of the pan and then transfer it to a cooling rack. Allow it to cool for 15 minutes before generously dusting the top of the focaccia with non-melting sugar, if using. 
1. Slice and serve the chocolate focaccia warm or at room temperature.  

## Make ahead & storage
